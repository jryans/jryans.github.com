Conference talk to be given at [HYTRADBOI 2022](https://www.hytradboi.com/)

## Abstract

[Local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) for creative
work resets the balance of ownership away from the cloud, allowing creators to
retain control of their work while still collaborating in real time with others.
This sounds like a magical ideal, but it also raises many new questions, such
as:

* How should data synchronisation work?
* What does user identity look like when collaborating?
* How is document access defined among several people?
* Is some kind of complex custom backend needed to handle all this?

In this talk, we examine one approach to collaborative, open software by
building on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), a secure, decentralised, real-time
communication protocol with generic database capabilities hiding beneath its
current focus on chat. We show through several examples and demos that Matrix
can assist with all of the questions above, allowing creative software to focus
on delivering the best experience while still meeting local-first ideals.

The software itself can also be collaborative and
[malleable](https://malleable.systems/), allowing for user customisation without
depending on upstream vendors to add a new options to achieve your goals.
