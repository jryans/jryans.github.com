...to replace what exactly? My LiveJournal from college...? I've never been great at maintaining any kind of journal / blog / whatever, but [Octopress](http://octopress.org) just looks like so much fun, so I had to give it a shot. Tonight I finally ripped the default theme up a bit to create a more minimalist look, which I think turned out quite well.

I'm hoping to start talking about all the crazy tech projects I've got brewing in my mind that I'll one day sit down and make progress on, along with a few bits of life, work, and everything else mixed in.

Even writing this tiny thing is more than I've done in ages. Any guesses how long until the next one?
