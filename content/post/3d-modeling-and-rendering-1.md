I've started taking classes at ACC to learn some visual design skills and
generally extend my knowledge of how games and other media are built.

The first one is this 3D modeling class, and I'll be maintaining a portfolio of
my work as this class goes on. I'm excited to see what I can come up with!
Undoubtedly my work won't win too many awards, but hopefully I can pick up the
principles and develop them further over time.

I think this will also give me a better understanding of the thought process that
design and creative teams go through at the various places I've worked now and in
the past.

Anyway, should be fun! :D
