I am available for part-time or short-term consulting work.

Here are some types of projects that work well:

- Isolated or research-heavy feature development
- Navigating older projects to adapt them for new requirements
- Performance optimisation
- Advising (sharing research, discussing technical approaches, etc.)

My areas of experience include:

- Compilers such as LLVM
- Web browsers like Firefox (which I worked on at Mozilla for 5 years)
- Debugging / profiling tools and related workflows
- Matrix, Mastodon / ActivityPub, and other open communication protocols

Feel free to review my [CV][cv] for more details on my past work.

you can contact me at [jryans@gmail.com][e].
