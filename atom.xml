    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve started taking classes at ACC to learn some visual design skills and
generally extend my knowledge of how games and other media are built.</p>

<p>The first one is this 3D modeling class, and I&#8217;ll be maintaining a portfolio of
my work as this class goes on. I&#8217;m excited to see what I can come up with!
Undoubtedly my work won&#8217;t win too many awards, but hopefully I can pick up the
principles and develop them further over time.</p>

<p>I think this will also give me a better understanding of the thought process that
design and creative teams go through at the various places I&#8217;ve worked now and in
the past.</p>

<p>Anyway, should be fun! :D</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;to replace what exactly? My LiveJournal from college&#8230;? I&#8217;ve never been great at maintaining any kind of journal / blog / whatever, but <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> just looks like so much fun, so I had to give it a shot. Tonight I finally ripped the default theme up a bit to create a more minimalist look, which I think turned out quite well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to start talking about all the crazy tech projects I&#8217;ve got brewing in my mind that I&#8217;ll one day sit down and make progress on, along with a few bits of life, work, and everything else mixed in.</p>

<p>Even writing this tiny thing is more than I&#8217;ve done in ages. Any guesses how long until the next one?</p>
