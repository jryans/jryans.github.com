<div class="section">Profile</div>

I enjoy building tools that improve the daily workflow of developers, designers,
and engineers. I want to work with a first-class team and collaborate with the
open source community to improve the applications people build by advancing the
state of the art in compilers, visual editors, IDEs, and other tooling.

Modern computing is far too rigid. Applications can only function in preset ways
determined by some far away team. Software is trapped in hermetically sealed
silos and is rewritten many times over rather than recomposed. This community
catalogs and experiments with malleable software and systems that reset the
balance of power.
