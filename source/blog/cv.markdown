<div class="section">Profile</div>

I believe security is both a fundamental right and also our biggest challenge in
today’s computing environment. Tools like KLEE, S²E, and angr which allow
analysis of binaries are an important path forward. I want to push the boundary
of what’s possible through new research and open source tools that apply
techniques like symbolic execution, fuzzing, and formal verification to
large-scale systems that people interact with every day.
