This is a snapshot of what's on my mind right now.

## Malleable systems

Modern computing is far too rigid. Applications can only function in preset ways
determined by some far away team. I am currently exploring how to make programs
more malleable and computing more humane so that anyone can reshape, extend,
compose, and share new functionality in ways that were never anticipated or
planned for. I hope to restore some of the magic that mainstream computing has
forgotten and give people more power to create the computing environment that
works for them.

While I have many ideas I would like to explore in this field, I've realised
that I'd like to first ensure there is a community space in which to discuss the
various ideas of malleable software. For the last few months, I've been
organising the [Malleable Systems Collective][collective], which I hope can
become such a place.

If these ideas interest you, I encourage you to check out the collective. I
would also appreciate any and all feedback on this, so please feel free to contact me via [email][e], [Matrix][m], [Twitter][t], or whatever way you prefer.
