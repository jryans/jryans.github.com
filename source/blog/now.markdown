This is a snapshot of what's on my mind right now. This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).

## Ideas

Modern computing is far too rigid. Applications can only function in preset ways
determined by some far away team. I am currently exploring how to make computing
more malleable so that anyone can reshape, extend, compose, and share new
functionality in ways that were never anticipated or planned for. I hope to
restore some of the magic that mainstream computing has forgotten and give
people more power to create the computing environment that works for them.

I am planning to add a specific project page about this once I've explored
existing research in this space and developed my own thoughts further.

## Learning

I recently attended the [Curry On 2019 conference][curryon2019] which was a
wonderful experience, and I think it's my new favourite conference! If you are
interested in the latest developments at the intersection of programming
language research and challenges from industry, I would highly recommend
attending in the future.

## Location

I recently moved to London, UK in February 2019. This is the first time I have
lived in a different country. My partner and I are having a great time exploring
all the different areas of London and traveling to other European cities that
are now quite easy to get to.
