This is a snapshot of what's on my mind right now.

## Ideas

Modern computing is far too rigid. Applications can only function in preset ways
determined by some far away team. I am currently exploring how to make programs
more malleable and computing more humane so that anyone can reshape, extend,
compose, and share new functionality in ways that were never anticipated or
planned for. I hope to restore some of the magic that mainstream computing has
forgotten and give people more power to create the computing environment that
works for them.

I am planning to add a specific project page about this once I've explored
existing research in this space and developed my own thoughts further. Here's
some of the related work I am examining:

* [Smalltalk][smalltalk], [Self][self], and the many related ideas from Alan
  Kay's group at Xerox PARC
* [The Future of Programming][futureprog] by Bret Victor
* [Cake language for composition][cake] by Stephen Kell
* Program inspection and reversing tools like [Frida][frida],
  [DTrace][dtrace], and [PANDA][panda]
* Tools for thought that meld the digital and physical worlds, such as:
    * [Muse][muse] and other [end-user programming experiments][eup] from Ink and Switch
    * [Seeing Spaces][seeing] by Bret Victor
* Desktop environments that are highly adaptable for many kinds of media, such
  as [Durden][durden]
* Mozilla's [X-Ray Googles][xray] and other in page inspectors

## Learning

I recently attended the [Curry On 2019 conference][curryon2019] which was a
wonderful experience, and I think it's my new favourite conference! If you are
interested in the latest developments at the intersection of programming
language research and challenges from industry, I would highly recommend
attending in the future.

## Location

I recently moved to London, UK in February 2019. This is the first time I have
lived in a different country. My partner and I are having a great time exploring
all the different areas of London and traveling to other European cities that
are now quite easy to get to.
