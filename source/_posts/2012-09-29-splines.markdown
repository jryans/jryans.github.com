### Overview

For this [assignment][a3], we learned a few new techniques, namely how to make
use of 2D shapes to give more detail to our models.  Beyond simple shapes like
circles and squares is the very flexible spline, which gives you a lot of
control over how a line is drawn, while still be purely analytical.

### Shapes and Splines

For part of the homework, we added some shapes and splines to our existing
models.  Below you can see the island huts from before, but with a few
additional decorations, such as some scary wiring / branches, as well as door
knobs and roof ornaments.

### Lathe and Loft

We also learned how to take 2D paths and morph them into 3D shapes in several
interesting ways.  You can use lathe to revolve the path around an axis, similar
to a torus.

I used this technique to create a pot, an inflatable pool, and a spyglass.

We also learned about loft, which will take a shape and replicate it in 3D
across whatever path you define.  This is another very powerful feature, with
many ways you can customize and tune its behavior.

I made several tracks and other shapes using this process:
