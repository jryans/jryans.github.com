### Overview

For our [first assignment][a1], we had to build a robot and an environment for the it to inhabit.

### Robot

The robot had to use exactly 1000 polygons. I chose to create a kind of
transport robot with a cute appearance. I used an elongated egg shape, and gave
it two propellers to maneuver. The robot is shown at an angle to suggest
movement.  The propellers were fun to construct, especially with the primitives,
since you have to think of clever ways to build what want from just a few
shapes. With two shapes and a few filters, I arrived at a convincing version of
propeller blades.

### Environment

For the environment, we had a budget of 10,000 polygons. I thought it would be
fun to create a water / island environment. However, even a poor simulation of
water quickly eats up a lot of polygons!

My thoughts here were that several of the robots might be used to transport
various items between the islands as needed.
