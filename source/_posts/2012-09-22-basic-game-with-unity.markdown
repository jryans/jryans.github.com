### Overview

For this week's [assignment][a2], we jumped out of the normal curriculum and
went straight to using a game engine with our models from last time.  We added a
few common elements, like terrain and fog.

### Unity

Unity is a lot of fun to work with! It's quite easy to assemble something pretty
cool, and yet it is also has a lot of depth to allow you to refine details. I
can definitely see myself working with this down the road, especially given the
wide multi-platform support.

### Game Level

For the level itself, I modified the environment to remove the static water I
made before and surround the island with mountainous terrain.  Then I added the
animated water to get back to the original environment idea.

From there, I added some basic lighting and fog to match the skybox I chose.  It
was actually a bit tricky to map a collider to the island huts.  For now I used
spheres, but perhaps I'll need to flatten those into a single mesh for Unity to
represent them accurately.

There's definitely room for improvement along many aspects, but it's really
exciting to see something playable come together so quickly.
