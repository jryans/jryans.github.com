### Overview

For this [assignment][a4], we learned how to apply materials to the objects
we've been creating.  There are many, many different ways to construct a
material that you apply to 3D object.  They can be procedurally generated, they
can pull from textures (or maps) you create, and you can manually tune many
parameters as well.

Maps are a great way to control the appearance of an object because you can make
something resemble a real object quite quickly by just taking a picture and
doing a bit of editing.

### Environment

For the environment, I used a variety of wood textures as maps to give the huts
a rustic feel.  The door particularly look much more believable now.  Also, the
islands look much less like strange brains now there's a grassy appearance
applied, instead of just the flat green.

### Robot

For the robot, I gave him a weathered, rusty metal appearance that seems to tie
in well with his supportive / charming look. Old, but still functioning just
fine.

The eyes and mouth have a bit of an ethereal / floating feel to them thanks to
the transparency.

It was fun to experiment with the various parameters and material types that can
give a metallic appearance.
