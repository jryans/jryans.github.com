      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am excited to announce that we&#8217;re now shipping WiFi debugging for Firefox OS!
It&#8217;s available in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building">Firefox OS 3.0 / master</a> with <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> on desktop.</p>

<p>WiFi debugging allows <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> to connect to your Firefox OS device via your local
WiFi network instead of a USB cable.</p>

<p>The connection experience is generally more straightforward (especially after
connecting to a device the first time) than with USB and also more convenient to
use since you&#8217;re no longer tied down by a cable.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>A large portion of this project has gone towards making the debugging
connection secure, so that you can use it safely on shared network, such as an
office or coffee shop.</p>

<p>We use TLS for encryption and authentication.  The computer and device both
create self-signed certificates.  When you connect, a QR code is scanned to
verify that the certificates can be trusted.  During the connection process, you
can choose to remember this information and connect immediately in the future if
desired.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to assemble the following bits and bobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox 39</a> (2015-03-27 or later)</li>
<li>Firefox OS 3.0 (2015-03-27 or later)

<ul>
<li>Option A: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Phone_guide/Flame/Updating_your_Flame#Updating_your_Flame_to_a_nightly_build">Update your Flame</a> to 3.0 / master</li>
<li>Option B: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building">Build for your device</a> from source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>On Firefox OS, enable WiFi debugging:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Developer Settings on device (Settings -> Developer)</li>
<li>Enable DevTools via Wi-Fi</li>
<li>Edit the device name if desired</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/posts/fxos-wifi-opts.png" alt="Firefox OS WiFi Debugging Options" /></p>

<p>To connect from Firefox Desktop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open WebIDE in Firefox Nightly (Tools -> Web Developer -> WebIDE)</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Select Runtime&#8221; to open the runtimes panel</li>
<li>Your Firefox OS device should show up in the &#8220;WiFi Devices&#8221; section</li>
<li>A connection prompt will appear on device, choose &#8220;Scan&#8221; or &#8220;Scan and Remember&#8221;</li>
<li>Scan the QR code displayed in WebIDE</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-wifi-runtime.png" alt="WebIDE WiFi Runtimes" />
<img src="/images/posts/webide-qr-code.png" alt="WebIDE Displays the QR Code" /></p>

<p>After scanning the QR code, the QR display should disappear and the &#8220;device&#8221;
icon in WebIDE will turn blue for &#8220;connected&#8221;.</p>

<p>You can then access all of your remote apps and browser tabs just as you can
today over USB.</p>

<h2>Technical Aside</h2>

<p>This process does not use ADB at all on the device, so if you find ADB
inconvenient while debugging or would rather not install ADB at all, then
WiFi debugging is the way to go.</p>

<p>By skipping ADB, we don&#8217;t have to worry about driver confusion, especially on
Windows and Linux.</p>

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<p>This feature should be supported on any Firefox OS device.  So far, I&#8217;ve tested
it on the Flame and Nexus 4.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>The QR code scanner can be a bit frustrating at the moment, as the real devices
appear to be capture a very low resolution picture.  <a href="https://bugzil.la/1145772">Bug 1145772</a> aims
to improve this soon.  You should be able to scan with the Flame by trying a few
different orientations.  I would suggest using &#8220;Scan and Remember&#8221;, so that
scanning is only needed for the first connection.</p>

<p>If you find other issues while testing, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a> or contact me
on IRC.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This was quite a complex project, and many people provided advice and reviews
while working on this feature, including (in semi-random order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Brian Warner</li>
<li>Trevor Perrin</li>
<li>David Keeler</li>
<li>Honza Bambas</li>
<li>Patrick McManus</li>
<li>Jason Duell</li>
<li>Panos Astithas</li>
<li>Jan Keromnes</li>
<li>Alexandre Poirot</li>
<li>Paul Rouget</li>
<li>Paul Theriault</li>
</ul>


<p>I am probably forgetting others as well, so I apologize if you were omitted.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d like to add this ability for Firefox for Android next.  Thankfully, most of
the work done here can be reused there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For quite a while, it has been possible to debug tabs on Firefox for Android
devices, but there were many steps involved, including manual port forwarding
from the terminal.</p>

<p>As I <a href="/blog/2014/10/14/debug-fxos-tabs/">hinted</a> a few weeks ago, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> would soon support connecting
to Firefox for Android via ADB Helper support, and that time is now!</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to assemble the following bits and bobs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox 36 (2014-10-25 or later)</li>
<li>ADB Helper 0.7.0 or later</li>
<li>Firefox for Android 35 or later</li>
</ul>


<p>Opening WebIDE for the first time should install ADB Helper if you don&#8217;t already
have it, but double-check it is the right version in the add-on manager.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-usb-runtime.png" alt="Firefox for Android runtime appears" /></p>

<p>Inside WebIDE, you&#8217;ll see an entry for Firefox for Android in the Runtime menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-tab-list.png" alt="Firefox for Android tab list" /></p>

<p>Once you select the runtime, tabs from Firefox for Android will be available in
the (now poorly labelled) apps menu on the left.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-tab-toolbox.png" alt="Inspecting a tab in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>Choosing a tab will open up the DevTools toolbox for that tab.  You can also
toggle the toolbox via the &#8220;Pause&#8221; icon in the top toolbar.</p>

<p>If you would like to debug Firefox for Android&#8217;s system-level / chrome code,
instead of a specific tab, you can do that with the &#8220;Main Process&#8221; option.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>

<p>We have even more connection UX improvements on the way, so I hope to have more
to share soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve had various tools for inspecting apps on remote devices for some time now,
but for a long time we&#8217;ve not had the same support for remote browser tabs.</p>

<p>To remedy this, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> now supports inspecting browser tabs running on Firefox OS devices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-tab.png" alt="Inspecting a tab in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>A few weeks back, WebIDE gained support for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009604">inspecting tabs</a> on the remote
device, but many of the likely suspects to connect to weren&#8217;t quite ready for
various reasons.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=975084">landed</a> the necessary server-side bits for Firefox OS, so you
should be able try this out by updating your device to the next nightly build
after 2014-10-14.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>After connecting to your device in WebIDE, any open browser tabs will appear at
the bottom of WebIDE&#8217;s project list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-tab-list.png" alt="Browser tab list in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>The toolbox should open automatically after choosing a tab.  You can also toggle
the toolbox via the &#8220;Pause&#8221; icon in the top toolbar.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re planning to make this work for Firefox for Android as well.  Much of
that work is already done, so I am hopeful that it will be available soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am excited to announce that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> is now enabled by default in Nightly
(Firefox 34)!  Everyone on the App Tools team has been working hard to polish
this new tool that we originally <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/webide-lands-in-nightly/">announced</a> back in June.</p>

<iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n8c34wk4OnY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>While the previous App Manager tool was great, that tool&#8217;s UX held us
back when trying support more complex workflows.  With the redesign into WebIDE,
we&#8217;ve already been able to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Editing

<ul>
<li>Great for getting started without worrying about an external editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Templates

<ul>
<li>Easy to focus on content from the start by using a template</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved DevTools Toolbox integration

<ul>
<li>Many UX issues arose from the non-standard way that App Manager used the
DevTools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Monitor">Monitor</a>

<ul>
<li>Live memory graphs help diagnose performance issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="https://thefiletree.com/jan/shots/monitor/monitor.png"/></p>

<h2>Transition</h2>

<p>All projects you may have created previously in the App Manager are also
available in WebIDE.</p>

<p>While the App Manager is now hidden, it&#8217;s accessible for now at
<code>about:app-manager</code>.  We do intend to remove it entirely in the future, so
it&#8217;s best to start using WebIDE today.  If you find any issues, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a>!</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>

<p>Looking ahead, we have many more exciting things planned for WebIDE, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command line integration</li>
<li>Improved support for app frameworks like Cordova</li>
<li>Validation that matches the Firefox Marketplace</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/02/17/into-the-open/">last post</a> (back in February&#8230;), I mentioned I was spending a lot of
time on the side working on the developer tools in web browsers, particularly
Firefox.  I find that Mozilla&#8217;s values, which truly put the user first, are
something I agree with wholeheartedly.  Mozilla is in a unique position in this
way, since all the other browsers are made by companies that, at the end of day,
are looking to make money to appease their shareholders.  Mozilla&#8217;s values are
even more important to emphasize these days with the various forms of
governmental spying that has been revealed in the last few months.</p>

<p>With that context, hopefully you can get an idea of how excited I am to say that
this past Monday was my first day as a Mozilla employee, working on the Firefox
Developer Tools team!</p>

<p>I am currently in Paris ramping up with the team for two weeks.  After the first
week, I am humbled to be able to say I am a part of this organization.  There
are so many people smarter than me here, and I am thrilled to have the
opportunity to work with them.  I know we will accomplish great things together.</p>

<p>There is so much potential in the web developer tools space.  Every developer
has their own workflow, favorite set of frameworks and tools, and new platform
technologies and techniques are coming out at a rapid pace.  While part of my
job is certainly to help make all of this more efficient, there is a lot of room
to shake things up by looking towards the future of web development and the
tools that people don&#8217;t even know they need.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be a blast! Hopefully I&#8217;ll have to some fun things to share.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m excited to start to focusing what time I do have on the side towards open
source projects.  I&#8217;m always on the lookout for good projects to help out with,
but these days I always seem to come back to web browsers.</p>

<p>In particular, I really enjoy working on tools that improve the lives of other
every day.  In that vein, I&#8217;d like to focus on improvements to the developer
tools in browsers today, though they are vastly better today than even a few
years ago.</p>

<p>The main open source options as far as web browsers go are Chrome / Chromium and
the various Mozilla projects, like Firefox. Near the end of 2011, I started
ramping up on the Chromium project, mainly because Chrome is the main browser I
used then.</p>

<p>However, now that Opera has decided to switch to Chromium for future versions of
their browser, I&#8217;ve been reminded that Mozilla is the only party in the web
development game that truly seems to be doing their best to fight for the user.
The main reason I stopped using Firefox was due to Chrome&#8217;s impressive developer
tools, so I&#8217;d like to help improve Firefox tools to bring them up to the level
we&#8217;ve now come to expect and beyond.</p>

<p>Likely I&#8217;ll dabble in both Chromium and Firefox, but no matter what it should be
an exciting time ahead!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For this <a href="http://viscom3d.blogspot.com/2012/09/materials-maps-and-surfacing.html">assignment</a>, we learned how to apply materials to the objects
we&#8217;ve been creating.  There are many, many different ways to construct a
material that you apply to 3D object.  They can be procedurally generated, they
can pull from textures (or maps) you create, and you can manually tune many
parameters as well.</p>

<p>Maps are a great way to control the appearance of an object because you can make
something resemble a real object quite quickly by just taking a picture and
doing a bit of editing.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<p>For the environment, I used a variety of wood textures as maps to give the huts
a rustic feel.  The door particularly look much more believable now.  Also, the
islands look much less like strange brains now there&#8217;s a grassy appearance
applied, instead of just the flat green.</p>

<h3>Robot</h3>

<p>For the robot, I gave him a weathered, rusty metal appearance that seems to tie
in well with his supportive / charming look. Old, but still functioning just
fine.</p>

<p>The eyes and mouth have a bit of an ethereal / floating feel to them thanks to
the transparency.</p>

<p>It was fun to experiment with the various parameters and material types that can
give a metallic appearance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For this <a href="http://viscom3d.blogspot.com/2012/09/spline-modeling-and-compound-objects.html">assignment</a>, we learned a few new techniques, namely how to make
use of 2D shapes to give more detail to our models.  Beyond simple shapes like
circles and squares is the very flexible spline, which gives you a lot of
control over how a line is drawn, while still be purely analytical.</p>

<h3>Shapes and Splines</h3>

<p>For part of the homework, we added some shapes and splines to our existing
models.  Below you can see the island huts from before, but with a few
additional decorations, such as some scary wiring / branches, as well as door
knobs and roof ornaments.</p>

<h3>Lathe and Loft</h3>

<p>We also learned how to take 2D paths and morph them into 3D shapes in several
interesting ways.  You can use lathe to revolve the path around an axis, similar
to a torus.</p>

<p>I used this technique to create a pot, an inflatable pool, and a spyglass.</p>

<p>We also learned about loft, which will take a shape and replicate it in 3D
across whatever path you define.  This is another very powerful feature, with
many ways you can customize and tune its behavior.</p>

<p>I made several tracks and other shapes using this process:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For this week&#8217;s <a href="http://viscom3d.blogspot.com/2012/09/unity-101.html">assignment</a>, we jumped out of the normal curriculum and
went straight to using a game engine with our models from last time.  We added a
few common elements, like terrain and fog.</p>

<h3>Unity</h3>

<p>Unity is a lot of fun to work with! It&#8217;s quite easy to assemble something pretty
cool, and yet it is also has a lot of depth to allow you to refine details. I
can definitely see myself working with this down the road, especially given the
wide multi-platform support.</p>

<h3>Game Level</h3>

<p>For the level itself, I modified the environment to remove the static water I
made before and surround the island with mountainous terrain.  Then I added the
animated water to get back to the original environment idea.</p>

<p>From there, I added some basic lighting and fog to match the skybox I chose.  It
was actually a bit tricky to map a collider to the island huts.  For now I used
spheres, but perhaps I&#8217;ll need to flatten those into a single mesh for Unity to
represent them accurately.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s definitely room for improvement along many aspects, but it&#8217;s really
exciting to see something playable come together so quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For our <a href="http://viscom3d.blogspot.com/2012/01/robot-in-ruins.html">first assignment</a>, we had to build a robot and an environment for the it to inhabit.</p>

<h3>Robot</h3>

<p>The robot had to use exactly 1000 polygons. I chose to create a kind of
transport robot with a cute appearance. I used an elongated egg shape, and gave
it two propellers to maneuver. The robot is shown at an angle to suggest
movement.  The propellers were fun to construct, especially with the primitives,
since you have to think of clever ways to build what want from just a few
shapes. With two shapes and a few filters, I arrived at a convincing version of
propeller blades.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<p>For the environment, we had a budget of 10,000 polygons. I thought it would be
fun to create a water / island environment. However, even a poor simulation of
water quickly eats up a lot of polygons!</p>

<p>My thoughts here were that several of the robots might be used to transport
various items between the islands as needed.</p>
