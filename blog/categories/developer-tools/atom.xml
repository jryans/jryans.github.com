    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce that we're now <a href="https://bugzil.la/1180996">shipping</a> WiFi debugging for
Firefox for Android!  It's available in <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox for Android 42</a>
with <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> on desktop.</p>

<p>The rest of this post will sound quite similar to the <a href="/blog/2015/03/25/wifi-debug-fxos/">previous announcement for
Firefox OS</a> support.</p>

<p>WiFi debugging allows <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> to connect to Firefox for Android via
your local WiFi network instead of a USB cable.</p>

<p>The connection experience is generally more straightforward (especially after
connecting to a device the first time) than with USB and also more convenient to
use since you're no longer tied down by a cable.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>A large portion of this project has gone towards making the debugging
connection secure, so that you can use it safely on shared network, such as an
office or coffee shop.</p>

<p>We use TLS for encryption and authentication.  The computer and device both
create self-signed certificates.  When you connect, a QR code is scanned to
verify that the certificates can be trusted.  During the connection process, you
can choose to remember this information and connect immediately in the future if
desired.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>You'll need to assemble the following bits and bobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox 42</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox for Android 42</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android">Barcode Scanner Android app by ZXing Team</a> (for QR code scanning)</li>
</ul>


<p>On your Android device:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android">Barcode Scanner Android app by ZXing Team</a></li>
<li>Open Firefox for Android</li>
<li>Go to Developer Tools Settings on device (Settings -> Developer Tools)</li>
<li>Enable Remote Debugging via Wi-Fi</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-wifi-opts.png" alt="Firefox for Android WiFi Debugging Options" /></p>

<p>To connect from Firefox Desktop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open WebIDE in Firefox Nightly (Tools -> Web Developer -> WebIDE)</li>
<li>Click "Select Runtime" to open the runtimes panel</li>
<li>Your Firefox for Android device should show up in the "WiFi Devices" section</li>
<li>A connection prompt will appear on device, choose "Scan" or "Scan and Remember"</li>
<li>Scan the QR code displayed in WebIDE</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-wifi-runtime.png" alt="WebIDE WiFi Runtimes" />
<img src="/images/posts/webide-qr-code.png" alt="WebIDE Displays the QR Code" /></p>

<p>After scanning the QR code, the QR display should disappear and the "device"
icon in WebIDE will turn blue for "connected".</p>

<p>You can then access all of your remote browser tabs just as you can today over
USB.</p>

<h2>Technical Aside</h2>

<p>This process does not use ADB at all on the device, so if you find ADB
inconvenient while debugging or would rather not install ADB at all, then
WiFi debugging is the way to go.</p>

<p>By skipping ADB, we don't have to worry about driver confusion, especially on
Windows and Linux.</p>

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<p>This feature should be supported on any Firefox for Android device.  So far,
I've tested it on the LG G2.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Thanks to all who helped via advice and reviews while working on Android support,
including (in semi-random order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Margaret Leibovic</li>
<li>Karim Benhmida</li>
</ul>


<p>And from the larger WiFi debugging effort:</p>

<ul>

<li>Trevor Perrin</li>
<li>David Keeler</li>
<li>Honza Bambas</li>

<li>Panos Astithas</li>
<li>Jan Keromnes</li>
<li>Alexandre Poirot</li>
<li>Paul Rouget</li>
<li>Paul Theriault</li>
</ul>


<p>I am probably forgetting others as well, so I apologize if you were omitted.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

team via <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/GetInvolved#Communication">various channels</a>.</p>

    <id>https://convolv.es/blog/2015/03/25/wifi-debug-fxos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce that we're now shipping WiFi debugging for Firefox OS!
It's available in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building">Firefox OS 3.0 / master</a> with <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> on desktop.</p>

<p>WiFi debugging allows <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> to connect to your Firefox OS device via your local

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>You'll need to assemble the following bits and bobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox 39</a> (2015-03-27 or later)</li>
<li>Firefox OS 3.0 (2015-03-27 or later)

<ul>
<li>Option A: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Phone_guide/Flame/Updating_your_Flame#Updating_your_Flame_to_a_nightly_build">Update your Flame</a> to 3.0 / master</li>
<li>Option B: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building">Build for your device</a> from source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>On Firefox OS, enable WiFi debugging:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Developer Settings on device (Settings -> Developer)</li>
<li>Enable DevTools via Wi-Fi</li>
<li>Edit the device name if desired</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/posts/fxos-wifi-opts.png" alt="Firefox OS WiFi Debugging Options" /></p>

<p>To connect from Firefox Desktop:</p>

<p>You can then access all of your remote apps and browser tabs just as you can
today over USB.</p>

WiFi debugging is the way to go.</p>

<p>By skipping ADB, we don't have to worry about driver confusion, especially on
Windows and Linux.</p>

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<p>This feature should be supported on any Firefox OS device.  So far, I've tested
it on the Flame and Nexus 4.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>The QR code scanner can be a bit frustrating at the moment, as real devices
appear to capture a very low resolution picture.  <a href="https://bugzil.la/1145772">Bug 1145772</a> aims
to improve this soon.  You should be able to scan with the Flame by trying a few
different orientations.  I would suggest using "Scan and Remember", so that
scanning is only needed for the first connection.</p>

<p>If you find other issues while testing, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a> or contact me
on IRC.</p>

</ul>


<p>I am probably forgetting others as well, so I apologize if you were omitted.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>I'd like to add this ability for Firefox for Android next.  Thankfully, most of
the work done here can be reused there.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Debugging Tabs with Firefox for Android]]></title>
    <link href="https://convolv.es/blog/2014/10/28/debug-fennec-tabs/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-28T16:08:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://convolv.es/blog/2014/10/28/debug-fennec-tabs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For quite a while, it has been possible to debug tabs on Firefox for Android
devices, but there were many steps involved, including manual port forwarding
from the terminal.</p>

<p>As I <a href="/blog/2014/10/14/debug-fxos-tabs/">hinted</a> a few weeks ago, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> would soon support connecting
to Firefox for Android via ADB Helper support, and that time is now!</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>You'll need to assemble the following bits and bobs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox 36 (2014-10-25 or later)</li>
<li>ADB Helper 0.7.0 or later</li>
<li>Firefox for Android 35 or later</li>
</ul>


<p>Opening WebIDE for the first time should install ADB Helper if you don't already
have it, but double-check it is the right version in the add-on manager.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-usb-runtime.png" alt="Firefox for Android runtime appears" /></p>

<p>Inside WebIDE, you'll see an entry for Firefox for Android in the Runtime menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-tab-list.png" alt="Firefox for Android tab list" /></p>

<p>Once you select the runtime, tabs from Firefox for Android will be available in
the (now poorly labelled) apps menu on the left.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fennec-tab-toolbox.png" alt="Inspecting a tab in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>Choosing a tab will open up the DevTools toolbox for that tab.  You can also
toggle the toolbox via the "Pause" icon in the top toolbar.</p>

<p>If you would like to debug Firefox for Android's system-level / chrome code,
instead of a specific tab, you can do that with the "Main Process" option.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>We have even more connection UX improvements on the way, so I hope to have more
to share soon!</p>

    <link href="https://convolv.es/blog/2014/10/14/debug-fxos-tabs/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-14T13:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://convolv.es/blog/2014/10/14/debug-fxos-tabs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've had various tools for inspecting apps on remote devices for some time now,
but for a long time we've not had the same support for remote browser tabs.</p>

<p>To remedy this, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> now supports inspecting browser tabs running on Firefox OS devices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-tab.png" alt="Inspecting a tab in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>A few weeks back, WebIDE gained support for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009604">inspecting tabs</a> on the remote
device, but many of the likely suspects to connect to weren't quite ready for
various reasons.</p>

<p>We've just <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=975084">landed</a> the necessary server-side bits for Firefox OS, so you
should be able try this out by updating your device to the next nightly build
after 2014-10-14.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>After connecting to your device in WebIDE, any open browser tabs will appear at
the bottom of WebIDE's project list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/webide-tab-list.png" alt="Browser tab list in WebIDE" /></p>

<p>The toolbox should open automatically after choosing a tab.  You can also toggle
the toolbox via the "Pause" icon in the top toolbar.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>We're planning to make this work for Firefox for Android as well.  Much of
that work is already done, so I am hopeful that it will be available soon.</p>

<p>If there are features you'd like to see added, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a> or contact the

    <link href="https://convolv.es/blog/2014/08/18/webide-enabled/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-18T10:44:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://convolv.es/blog/2014/08/18/webide-enabled</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> is now enabled by default in Nightly
(Firefox 34)!  Everyone on the App Tools team has been working hard to polish
this new tool that we originally <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/webide-lands-in-nightly/">announced</a> back in June.</p>

<iframe src="https://convolv.es//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n8c34wk4OnY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>While the previous App Manager tool was great, that tool's UX held us
back when trying support more complex workflows.  With the redesign into WebIDE,
we've already been able to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Editing

<ul>
<li>Great for getting started without worrying about an external editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Templates

<ul>
<li>Easy to focus on content from the start by using a template</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved DevTools Toolbox integration

<ul>
<li>Many UX issues arose from the non-standard way that App Manager used the
DevTools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Monitor">Monitor</a>

<ul>
<li>Live memory graphs help diagnose performance issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="https://thefiletree.com/jan/shots/monitor/monitor.png"/></p>

<h2>Transition</h2>

<p>All projects you may have created previously in the App Manager are also
available in WebIDE.</p>

<p>While the App Manager is now hidden, it's accessible for now at
<code>about:app-manager</code>.  We do intend to remove it entirely in the future, so
it's best to start using WebIDE today.  If you find any issues, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a>!</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Looking ahead, we have many more exciting things planned for WebIDE, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command line integration</li>
<li>Improved support for app frameworks like Cordova</li>
<li>Validation that matches the Firefox Marketplace</li>
</ul>


<p>If there are features you'd like to see added, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a> or contact the
