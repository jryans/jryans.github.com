    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> is now enabled by default in Nightly
(Firefox 34)!  Everyone on the App Tools team has been working hard to polish
this new tool that we originally <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/webide-lands-in-nightly/">announced</a> back in June.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>While the previous App Manager tool was great, that tool's UX held us
back when trying support more complex workflows.  With the redesign into WebIDE,
we've already been able to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Editing

<ul>
<li>Great for getting started without worrying about an external editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Templates

<ul>
<li>Easy to focus on content from the start by using a template</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved DevTools Toolbox integration

<ul>
<li>Many UX issues arose from the non-standard way that App Manager used the
DevTools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Monitor">Monitor</a>

<ul>
<li>Live memory graphs help diagnose performance issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transition</h2>

<p>All projects you may have created previously in the App Manager are also
available in WebIDE.</p>

<p>While the App Manager is now hidden, it's accessible for now at
<code>about:app-manager</code>.  We do intend to remove it entirely in the future, so
it's best to start using WebIDE today.  If you find any issues, please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a>!</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Looking ahead, we have many more exciting things planned for WebIDE, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command line integration</li>
<li>Improved support for app frameworks like Cordova</li>
<li>Validation that matches the Firefox Marketplace</li>
</ul>


<p>If there are features you'd like to see added, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20WebIDE">file bugs</a> or contact the
team via <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/GetInvolved#Communication">various channels</a>.</p>

    <id>http://convolv.es/blog/2013/08/25/mozilla</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/02/17/into-the-open/">last post</a> (back in February...), I mentioned I was spending a lot of
time on the side working on the developer tools in web browsers, particularly
Firefox.  I find that Mozilla's values, which truly put the user first, are
something I agree with wholeheartedly.  Mozilla is in a unique position in this
way, since all the other browsers are made by companies that, at the end of day,
are looking to make money to appease their shareholders.  Mozilla's values are
even more important to emphasize these days with the various forms of
governmental spying that has been revealed in the last few months.</p>

<p>With that context, hopefully you can get an idea of how excited I am to say that
this past Monday was my first day as a Mozilla employee, working on the Firefox
Developer Tools team!</p>

<p>I am currently in Paris ramping up with the team for two weeks.  After the first
week, I am humbled to be able to say I am a part of this organization.  There
are so many people smarter than me here, and I am thrilled to have the
opportunity to work with them.  I know we will accomplish great things together.</p>

<p>There is so much potential in the web developer tools space.  Every developer
has their own workflow, favorite set of frameworks and tools, and new platform
technologies and techniques are coming out at a rapid pace.  While part of my
job is certainly to help make all of this more efficient, there is a lot of room
to shake things up by looking towards the future of web development and the
tools that people don't even know they need.</p>

<p>It's going to be a blast! Hopefully I'll have to some fun things to share.</p>

    <id>http://convolv.es/blog/2013/02/17/into-the-open</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm excited to start to focusing what time I do have on the side towards open
source projects.  I'm always on the lookout for good projects to help out with,
but these days I always seem to come back to web browsers.</p>

<p>In particular, I really enjoy working on tools that improve the lives of other
every day.  In that vein, I'd like to focus on improvements to the developer
tools in browsers today, though they are vastly better today than even a few
years ago.</p>

<p>The main open source options as far as web browsers go are Chrome / Chromium and
the various Mozilla projects, like Firefox. Near the end of 2011, I started
ramping up on the Chromium project, mainly because Chrome is the main browser I
used then.</p>

<p>However, now that Opera has decided to switch to Chromium for future versions of
their browser, I've been reminded that Mozilla is the only party in the web
development game that truly seems to be doing their best to fight for the user.
The main reason I stopped using Firefox was due to Chrome's impressive developer
tools, so I'd like to help improve Firefox tools to bring them up to the level
we've now come to expect and beyond.</p>

<p>Likely I'll dabble in both Chromium and Firefox, but no matter what it should be
an exciting time ahead!</p>
