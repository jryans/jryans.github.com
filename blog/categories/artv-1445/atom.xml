    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've started taking classes at ACC to learn some visual design skills and
generally extend my knowledge of how games and other media are built.</p>

<p>The first one is this 3D modeling class, and I'll be maintaining a portfolio of
my work as this class goes on. I'm excited to see what I can come up with!
Undoubtedly my work won't win too many awards, but hopefully I can pick up the
principles and develop them further over time.</p>

<p>I think this will also give me a better understanding of the thought process that
design and creative teams go through at the various places I've worked now and in
the past.</p>

<p>Anyway, should be fun! :D</p>
