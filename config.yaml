      I enjoy building tools as part of a community that empowers domain experts
      to control and modify their digital workflows by tearing down the
      boundaries typically imposed by siloed applications from different
      vendors.

      I am organising the [Malleable Systems
      Collective](https://malleable.systems), a community that catalogs and
      experiments with malleable software and systems.

      I am currently building open, decentralized, secure communications for all
      via [Matrix](https://matrix.org) at [Element](https://element.io) in
      London, UK.

      I previously worked at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) on [developer
      tools](https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools) for Firefox and Firefox OS.

      I also worked on overhauling the Firefox [CSS
      system](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo) using
      [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and tech from
      [Servo](https://servo.org).
