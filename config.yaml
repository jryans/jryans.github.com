      I enjoy building tools as part of a community that empowers domain experts
      to control and modify their digital workflows by tearing down the
      boundaries typically imposed by siloed applications from different
      vendors.

      I am organising the [Malleable Systems
      Collective](https://malleable.systems), a community that catalogs and
      experiments with malleable software and systems.

      I am researching reliable debugging and malleable software with [Dr.
      Stephen Kell](https://www.humprog.org/~stephen/) at King's College London.

      I previously worked at [Element](https://element.io) building open,
      decentralized, secure communications for all via
      [Matrix](https://matrix.org). I also worked at
      [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) on developer tools for Firefox,
      and I overhauled the Firefox
      [CSS system](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo) using
      [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and tech from
      [Servo](https://servo.org).
